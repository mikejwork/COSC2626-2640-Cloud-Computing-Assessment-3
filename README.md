## Assignment notes
Starting this assignment i was moderately confident with AWS services, after completing i feel much more confident. If i was to go back and re-make this application i would not use python flask, i would instead opt for Node.js and React.js, using AWS Amplify, This would allow me to create a more reactive interface for the user and ease the development experience.
