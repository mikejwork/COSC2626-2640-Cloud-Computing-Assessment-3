### Personal Assignment notes:
From previous assessments within this subject i have become more confident with web applications using AWS.
I have changed my previous outlook on the assessment from an online store to a budgeting application, to track bank accounts
and savings, also enabling the user to input the stocks that they own, using a third party API be able to get prices of these stocks
and show a live price of their assets to the user.
